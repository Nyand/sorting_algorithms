# 0x1B C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

In this project, the main task is to implement various sorting algorithms.

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:
0. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using Bubble sort algorithm
1. Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using Insertion sort algorithm
2. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
3. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
4. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence
5. Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm
6. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm
7. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge sort algorithm
8. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm
9. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm
10. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm
11. Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
12. Function that sorts a deck of cards. Prototype: void sort_deck(deck_node_t **deck);

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:
* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files provided by ALX School.

## Helper Files:
* [print_array.c](./print_array.c): C function that prints an array of
integers. Provided by ALX School.
* [print_list.c](./print_list.c): C function that prints a `listint_t`
doubly-linked list. Provided by ALX School.

## Header Files:
* [sort.h](./sort.h): Header file containing definitions and prototypes for
all types and functions written for the project.
* [deck.h](./deck.h): Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types
and functions written for the task `1000-sort_deck.c`.
